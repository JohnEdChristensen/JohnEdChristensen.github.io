## What is it?
[WebbCompare](https:\\www.webbcompare.com) is a tool I build to compare James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images to Hubble Space Telescope images.
It is a website designed for a general audience to appreciate the beauty of the universe that we are slowly uncovering.

The site shows how large of a leap in scientific capability the James Webb Space Telescope is, and emphasizes that its success is a major milestone in our history.
## Why did I make it?
I have always been fascinated by Hubble's images. Growing up I loved watching PBS Space documentaries and going to planetarium shows where I gawked over the beautiful images and was humbled by the un-comprehensible size and distance of the stellar subjects.

The fact that the JWST is capable of far outperforming the images I loved as a child was another humbling experience. These images are just the beginning of a new chapter of human exploration, and I'm optimistic that what remains to be discovered will continue to humble and inspire everyone that watches.

## How it's made 
WebbCompare uses [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) for zooming and panning around both the Hubble and Webb images.

It is hosted using Github Pages.
