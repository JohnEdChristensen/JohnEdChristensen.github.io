Growing up I loved watching PBS Space documentaries and going to planetarium shows where I gawked over the beautiful images and was humbled by the un-comprehensible size and distance of the stellar subjects.\n\nThe fact that the JWST is capable of far outperforming the images I loved as a child was another humbling experience. These images are just the beginning of a new chapter of human exploration, and I'm optimistic that what remains to be discovered will continue to humble and inspire everyone that watches.\n\n## How was the reception of the tool?\n### Science Communicators/Experts\n {{\u003c tweet user=\"hankgreen\" id=\"1546958021086965760\" \u003e}}\n {{\u003c tweet user=\"astrocaits\" id=\"1546954277226254337\" \u003e}}\n \n### General public\n {{\u003c tweet user=\"wbelote\" id=\"1547026840945979393\" \u003e}}\n {{\u003c tweet user=\"penguinsrule27\" id=\"1547270256607088641\" \u003e}}\n\n \n## How it's made \nWebbCompare uses [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) for zooming and panning around both the Hubble and Webb images.\n\nIt is hosted using Github Pages.","lastmodified":"2022-07-15T23:53:25.202944435Z","tags":null}}
